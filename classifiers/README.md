# Image Age and Gender Recognition

This module uses pre-trained models to estimate the age and gender of a person in an image. 
It utilizes both TensorFlow for age and gender estimation and OpenCV for face detection and landmarks extraction. 
Additionally, it includes support for using Caffe models for age and gender estimation.


## Getting Started

These instructions will help you get a copy of the project up and running on your local machine.

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/image-age-gender-recognition.git
   cd image-age-gender-recognition
    ```
2. **Install Dependencies**:
    ```bash
    pip3 install -r requirements.txt
    ```
3. **Run the Application**:
   ```bash
   python3 main.py
   ```
   
## Usage

The application can be run using the following command:

```bash
python3 main.py
```

The application will then prompt you to enter the path to the image you want to process. 
After entering the path, the application will process the image and display the results.
