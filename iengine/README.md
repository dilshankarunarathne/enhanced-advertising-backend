## Introduction

The `ad_topic_recommender` package is a simple tool that recommends interesting topics based on a person's age and gender. This documentation provides information on how to install and use the package, along with examples and other relevant details.

## Installation

You can install the `ad_topic_recommender` package using pip:

```bash
pip install ad-topic-recommender
```

## Usage

### Command Line Interface

The package provides a command-line interface (CLI) for easy topic recommendations. You can use it as follows:

```bash
ad_topic_recommender --age <age> --gender <gender>
```

Replace <age> with the person's age and <gender> with their gender (e.g., "male" or "female"). 
The CLI will then print out a recommended topic.

### Python Library

You can also use the package as a Python library in your own projects. Here's an example of how to use it:

```python
from ad_topic_recommender import recommend_topic

age = 30
gender = "male"

topic = recommend_topic(age, gender)
print(f"Recommended topic for a {age}-year-old {gender}: {topic}")
```
